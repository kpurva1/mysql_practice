//Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:
ID - number
city - varchar
state - varchar
lat_n - number
long_w - number

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

Sample Input

Let's say that CITY only has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY

Sample Output

ABC 3
PQRS 4

//




(select s1.city,length(s1.city)
from station as s1,(select min(length(city)) minl,max(length(city)) maxl from station )as s2
where length(s1.city) = s2.minl 
order by city
limit 1)

union

(select s1.city,length(s1.city)
from station as s1,(select min(length(city)) minl,max(length(city)) maxl from station )as s2
where  length(s1.city) = s2.maxl
order by city
